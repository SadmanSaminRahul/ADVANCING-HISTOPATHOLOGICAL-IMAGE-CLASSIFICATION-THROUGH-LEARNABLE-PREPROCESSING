# Histopathological Image Classification with Learnable Preprocessing and Custom Architectures

This project was developed as part of our Machine Learning & AI course at BUET (EEE 402, July 2025). It focuses on improving diagnostic accuracy in histopathological images using advanced deep learning techniques.

## üîç Project Overview

- **Goal**: Classify colon and lung cancer types using H&E-stained histopathological images.
- **Key Innovations**:
  - Learnable preprocessing using Macenko normalization + U-Net segmentation
  - Optimized augmentation using grid search
  - Custom CNN model (HistPathNet) with CBAM attention
  - Comparative evaluation with ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet-121, and Vision Transformer

## üß† Model Architecture

HistPathNet is a U-Net-inspired architecture enhanced with CBAM attention modules and dual output heads for segmentation and classification.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Name**: [Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological Images](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ambarish/lung-colon-cancer-histopathological-images)
- 25,000 images, 5 classes
- We used a sampled, balanced subset of 2,000 images
