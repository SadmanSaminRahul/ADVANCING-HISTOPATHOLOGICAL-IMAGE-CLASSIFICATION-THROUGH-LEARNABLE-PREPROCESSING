## üî¨ Overview
This project was developed as part of our Machine Learning & AI course at BUET (EEE 402, July 2025). It focuses on improving diagnostic accuracy in histopathological images using advanced deep learning techniques. It involves a deep learning framework for histopathological image classification that introduces **learnable preprocessing** and **custom neural architectures** to advance cancer detection accuracy. This project addresses critical limitations in current state-of-the-art models by incorporating adaptive preprocessing techniques and attention mechanisms specifically designed for medical imaging.

## üéØ Key Features

- **Learnable Preprocessing Pipeline**: Macenko normalization and U-Net segmentation for enhanced feature extraction
- **Custom HistPathNet Architecture**: Novel CNN with CBAM attention mechanism for dual segmentation-classification
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Supports 5 classes including colon normal, colon adenocarcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, lung benign, and lung squamous cell carcinoma
- **Explainable AI Integration**: Grad-CAM and SHAP visualizations for model interpretability
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Comparison with ResNet-50, EfficientNet-B0, DenseNet-121, and Vision Transformer

## üèÜ Performance Highlights

- **96% Scaled Accuracy** on 2,000-image subset with HistPathNet
- **2-3% improvement** over baseline models in single-epoch training
- **10-20% performance boost** from learnable preprocessing components
- **Superior AUROC of 0.96** demonstrating excellent classification reliability
